    <h1> <strong>Toll Gate Blood Drive </strong> </h1>
  </body>
  <p> Toll Gate High School runs multiple blood drives a year. It is open to all students and staff, usually from 8:00 am to 2:00 pm. The blood drive is usually operated by a teacher and a student representative. Students 16 or older are encouraged to talk to a parent/guardian about donating. These blood donations can help out so many people.
